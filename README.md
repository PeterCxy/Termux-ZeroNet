# Termux-ZeroNet
ZeroNet Bootstrap Script for Termux (Android App)

This fork was an attempt to fix the issues with the original script. 

To use this, simply download Termux and get the zn.sh file onto your phone. 

You can use any method to upload the zn.sh file onto your phone, but you might have to run termux-setup-storage to navigate to if

you can't figure out how to. Afterwards, run bash zn.sh and the script will install all the needed dependencies for Zeronet and

begin running the service. Now all you have to do is open your browser and navigate to a Zeronet page to get started.
